\section{What is a Service?}

\textit{Serivce} is one of the most used words in the area of software architecture and has been differently defined in many papers, books and blogposts in various contexts. 

The 4+1 View concept by XY suggests to split the complexity of a software design in multiple views like A,B,C. During the research for this thesis we discovered that the difficulty to clearly define the word Service lies in the fact that different definitions focus on different views. For this thesis we use multiple definitions for Service depending if we talk about the \textit{logical} or the \textit{technical} view of a service.

\subsection{A logical Service}

\begin{quotation}
A service is the technical authority for a specific business capability - Udi Dahan TODO quote
\end{quotation}
   
This definition focuses more on the logical or business view of a service than it's technical representation. All data and business rules required to fulfil a business specification reside in the Service. 

This definition implies that a Service is not restricted to one process, one technology or one layer. "Vielmehr" it contains it's own layers including databases, logic and UI code if needed. 
%TODO: \gls{?}

A logical service is autonomous and can be composed of many processes, webservices or databases, but keeps a clear boundary and interface against the outer world. Communication with other parts of the system only happens on a well defined interface on a common communication channel.

\subsubsection{Bounded Context}

Another concept describing logical Services is the Bounded Context as defined in the Domain Driven Design (TODO Evans). 

TODO Bounded Context definition. Focus on internal and external concepts and language.

\subsection{A technical Service}

\begin{quotation}
	[Definition Fowler]
\end{quotation}

This definition by Martin Fowler is much more technical oriented than the one by Udi Dahan and is close to what  lately has been advertised as \textit{Microservice}. A process providing a remote API might provide business logic, pure technical functionality or a data store, of which the latest is often seen nowadays wrapped by a RESTful HTTP API.

A technical Service might be "deckungsgleich" with a logical service but very often more complex cases split logical services in multiple technical Services. 

While it is often good to align technical services along business capabilities, other more technical factors might define the boundaries of Microservices. Factors driving the decomposition of a system into Services are discussed in more detail in the next Section.

\section{Driving factors for Service Decomposition}

\subsection{Fundamentals}

\subsubsection{Single Responsibility Principle}

\subsubsection{High Cohesion, Loose Coupling}

\subsection{Coupling Criteria}

Louse Coupling, High cohesion, SIP
"http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The\_Single\_Responsibility\_Principle"

Different type of coupling in Industry and in Theory

List of identified coupling criteria

Aggregates: Consistency Constraints, Root interface, transactions, sync internally \& async externally. Not to be split up between remote microservices

User stories as most important criteria: check Ivar Jacobson, oose, a use case driven approach


%TODO: (Bring result \& discussion already here?)

\chapter{Requirements}
\label{cha:requirements}

This chapter describes the (non-)functional requirements of the target solution and covers the characteristics of it's target users. 

The requirements in this chapter are not prioritised. As part of the sprint planning meetings, these requirements are transformed to tasks and prioritised. The description in this chapter is meant to provide a high level overview and establish a common sense between all stakeholders of this project.

\input{requirements/personas}
\input{requirements/functional}
\input{requirements/nonfunctional}


\bigskip

After defining all (non-)functional requirements, the next Chapter outlines design and implementation steps which were taken to satisfy these requirements.


\chapter{Design and Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}


\section{Design} 


\subsection{Technology}


\subsection{Infrastructure}



\bigskip
After covering the important design and implementation aspects, the next chapter assesses the built solution described in this chapter against the defined requirements.

\chapter{Working with the Service Cutter}
%TODO: Does this chapter make sense? it could cover the process of working with the service cutter, finding the needed information, intepreting the results and using it for decision finding and documentations (ADs). Giersche highly recommended/requested this. 

How do you initially populate all the coupling data? LOTS of knowledge is required!
o   How do you organize such an interview?

\chapter{Conclusion}


\section{Future Work}

* Caching (Data Redundancy) as a way to reduce temporary reduce coupling between services could be a further suggestions of the Service Cutter

* Suggestions for APIs (REST) or Message types

\chapter{Project Management}
\label{cha:projectmgmt}

This Appendix documents aspects of project management like methodology, roles, environment, quality management, and risk management. The project was time boxed and started on \formatdate{14}{9}{2015} and ended on \formatdate{18}{12}{2015} which implies 14 working weeks.
