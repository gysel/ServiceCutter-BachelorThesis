\chapter{Implementation Details}
\label{appendix:implementationDetails}

This appendix documents miscellaneous implementation details.

\section{Docker Compose}
\label{appendix:dockerCompose}

A \gls{yaml} file is used to configure and start all Docker containers required for the Service Cutter. The file shown in Listing \ref{code:dockercompose} is delivered as \texttt{docker-compose.yml} in the source code of the Service Cutter.

In a productive environment the default passwords have to be changed.

\section{JSON Schema Export}
\label{appendix:exportSchema}

Listing \ref{code:exportSchema} lists the JSON Schema that specifies the export format for candidate service cuts.

\section{Performance}
\label{app:performance}

This section theoretically discusses whether the Service Cutter scales to support large data volumes.

The theoretical number of edges may cause performance problems. The maximum number of edges in a graph can be described using a formula: A graph of $n$ nodes, where every node is connected to all other nodes, has $e$ edges.

\begin{displaymath}
e = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\end{displaymath}

The number of edges grows almost quadratically with up to 1'999'000 edges for 2000 nodes.

Our implementation however will unlikely have anything close to the theoretical number of edges as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Coupling of type \textit{cohesiveness} only adds edges where nanoservices are in a relationship with each other.
	\item Coupling of type \textit{compatibility} only adds a negative score (penalty) to existing relationships.
	\item Coupling of type \textit{constraint} only removes existing edges.
\end{itemize}

The number of edges can therefore only cause problems when a cohesiveness coupling is specified that includes a large number of nodes. An example of such a coupling is for a use case including a very large number of nanoentities which is a very unlikely case. We therefore conclude that the number of edges is probably not an issue.
