\section{Project Status}

Every sprint one or two status meetings where held to track the progress.

\subsection{Kick Off \formatdate{15}{9}{2015}}

\textbf{Time:} 14:00 – 15:15

\textbf{Next Meeting:} \formatdate{21}{9}{2015} 10:30

\textbf{Attendees:} Olaf Zimmermann (ZIO), Lukas Kölbener (KOE), Michael Gysel (GYS)

\textbf{Agenda}
\begin{itemize}
\item Meetings, Sprints
\item Aufgabenstellung
\item Discussion on the subject of the thesis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The automatic REST interface of Apache ISIS could be an inspiration
\item Vaughn Vernon provides his DDD samples on \href{https://github.com/VaughnVernon/IDDD_Samples}{GitHub}
\item The provided article by Subbu Allamaraju is a must-read.
\item General approach: Start with business requirements (Use Cases, User Stories) and transform them into Components (e.g. UML). These Components are then modeled into services.
\item UML Components approach: Identification, Specification, Realization. (Our tool would probably support the step from spec to realization)
\item Possible quality attributes: Coupling, Cohesion, Security, Performance, Data volatility, Frequency of updates, Monitoring, Reconciliation, Consistency, Data invariants, Data Volumes
\item Structurizer by Simon Brown is a possible input format
\item C4: Context, Container, Components, Classes
\item Swagger is a possible output of the tool
\item Idea: Quality attributes should be specified on the level of fields instead of entities.
\item New item in the reading list: \url{https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954587.aspx} 
\item NFR: Number of entities/fields to be supported
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decisions}
\begin{itemize}
\item MoM and Meetings should be handled the same way as in the SA.
\item Project management should be < 10\% of the overall effort.
\item Model reconciliation is out of scope!
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Agenda}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scope and content of the thesis

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Coupling Criterion / architectural significant requirements

\item The data used in multiple bounded contexts should be part of the \enquote{published language} (DDD)
\item Dr. Gerald Reif will take the role of the expert
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decisions}
\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Status Meeting \formatdate{15}{10}{2015}}

\textbf{Time:} 11:00 - 12:00

\textbf{Next Meetings:} \formatdate{19}{10}{2015} 14:00, Z\"uhlke; \formatdate{22}{10}{2015} 09:00, HSR
 
\textbf{Attendees:} Olaf Zimmermann (ZIO), Lukas Kölbener (KOE), Michael Gysel (GYS)

\textbf{Agenda}

\begin{itemize}
\item Thesis \& documentation progress
\item Outcome discussion with O. Augenstein // Complexity, alternative approaches
\item Date of intermediate presentation (Zwischenpr\"asentation)
\item Interest of industry contacts
\item Idea workshop Monday @ Z\"uhlke
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The thesis title needs to be finalized by mid November.
\item \enquote{Service} is a good candidate for the things produced by the service cutter. Conflicting definitions exist for \enquote{Service} of which some focus on business capability and others on providing a remote API. 
\item Possible example project candidates are Netstal (\url{http://wwww.netstal.com}) and the master thesis by Jonas Biedermann.
\item The clustering approach has multiple flaws which are hard to overcome. A new approach using theory of sets is inspired by the discussion with Prof. O. Augenstein and will be analyzed within this sprint. 
\item Good visualization of the service cutter input and good traceability within the tool might support the taking and documentation of architectural decisions.
\item Andreas Rinkel will take the role of the \enquote{Gegenleser} for this bachelor thesis.
\item ZIO provided further ideas and research material on the topic of coupling criteria and decomposition. 
\end{itemize}

\item ZIO: Find date for intermediate presentation during 9-11. November (21.10)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Status Meeting \formatdate{22}{10}{2015}}
\label{sec:status22102015}

\textbf{Attendees}: Wolfgang Giersche, Olaf Zimmermann (ZIO), Lukas Kölbener (KOE), Michael Gysel (GYS)
 
\textbf{Next Meeting}: 19.11.2015, 11:00 @HSR / Skype

\textbf{Agenda}

\begin{itemize}
\item Admin: Sign paper regarding usage rights
\item Demo: Prototype, development environment
\item Coupling Criteria Catalog
\item Algorithms and coupling quantification
\item Sample project (not discussed)
\end{itemize}
 
\textbf{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Maintainability is important. Coupling Criteria should be changeable with an appropriate effort.
\item Findings discussion on the algorithm / approach.
\subitem Calculating a score of every possible service cut is not possible.
\subitem New term: Candidate Service Cut.
\subitem Idea W.G.: Start with a heuristic approach like “Substantiv-Clustering”, a set of Candidate Service Cuts derived from a graph cluster or an analysis using only one Coupling Criteria.
\subitem Document needs to explain why we did not “just use a graph cluster”.
\item Three step approach is probably required
\subitem Determine a set of Candidate Service Cuts (perform once) (needs to be a smart solution – not a brute force approach! E.g. 100 possibilities.)
\subitem Assess all Candidates with a given set of weights to come up with a score.
\subitem Evaluate all Candidates with priorities by CC to find best choices.
\item Idea: Shake solution to improve it.
\end{itemize}
 
\textbf{Decisions}

\begin{itemize}
\item It is not an exact science – a good solution is enough.
\item No complete freeze of the CC catalog as of now.
\item Performance for 100 Entities, 2000 Fields:
\subitem Calculate Candidate Service Cuts (Steps 1\&2) – less than 10 minutes
\subitem Evaluate Candidates with parametrized weights (Step 3) – less than 5 seconds
\end{itemize}
 
\textbf{Action Items}

\begin{itemize}
\item GYS/KOE: Send documentation to ZIO for a review by the end of Oct.
\item GYS/KOE: Enhance Coupling Catalog with Decomposition Impact, Example (maybe from trading system), Measurement/Quantification, Type (Distance/Proximity/Constraint)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HSR Status Meeting \formatdate{11}{11}{2015}}

\textbf{Attendees}: Olaf Zimmermann (ZIO), Lukas Kölbener (KOE), Michael Gysel (GYS)
 
\textbf{Next Meeting}: tbd

\textbf{Agenda}

\begin{itemize}
\item Status of thesis / development
\item Sprint Goals 3 \& 4
\item Sample Project
\item Personas
\item Final presentation
\item Discussion Thesis Review
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item The cargo tracking sample application is currently being reimplemented. Maybe take a look at it to use it as test project.
\item Can we apply the service cutter to the service cutter domain model? Good for credibility to test one's own systems. 
\item Personas are very good. Add an Enterprise Architect.
\item Papers on coupling: (focus on object oriented code, not architecture!)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=\&arnumber=1605186}
		\item \url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=\&arnumber=4021375\&tag=1}
	\end{itemize}
\item Ideas for a renaming of \enquote{data field}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Micro entity
		\item Nano entity
		\item Candidate Entity
		\item Nano service
	\end{itemize}
\item Describe every concept with an example
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Additional feedback by ZIO}
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain that criteria catalog does not aim for completeness.
\item Introduce example earlier .
\item Visualize coupling types.
\item Apply Service Cutter concepts/tool to Service Cutter design (as an additional validation step in last sprint).
\item Generalize from use case/user story as input (of busienss-level operations) to conceptual components (e.g. CRC cards)?
\item Make sure that all tool output can be reproduced, or that tool output can be consumed as input (e.g. in follow on projects or subsequent but delayed iterations in a project), consider previously proposed service cuts as one special type of legacy system constraint?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decisions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Notation
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Web uppercase
	\item service lowercase
	\item coupling criteria lowercase
	\item Service Cutter uppercase
	\end{itemize}
\item Final term instead of \enquote{data field} should be finalized in the next meeting.
\end{itemize}
 
\textbf{Action Items}

\begin{itemize}
\item ZIO: Find date for Abschlusspräsentation. (14. – 22. Januar)
\item ZIO: Send mentioned papers/books on pages 8 and 11.
\item GYS/KOE: Prepare suggestions for meetings in December.
