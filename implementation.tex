\subsection{Information Security}

The web application is secured using an authentication and authorization implementation. Any other internal components such as the database or web services are hidden behind the servers firewall and therefore do not need any special security measures.

The uploaded data models are initially shared amongst all registered users.

\subsection{User Interface}

The base layout is responsive and adapts to smaller screens such as smartphones. However the tool is mostly used on devices such as laptops and the controls are therefore optimized for use on screens that are at least 15 inches wide and used with a mouse and a keyboard.

After covering the important design and implementation aspects, the next chapter assesses the built solution described in this chapter against the defined requirements.
