\chapter{Decomposition Model}

The decomposition model describes the quality attributes of good service decomposition solutions and the criteria leading to such. This chapter starts with an overview over all defined coupling criteria and concludes with the definition of a good decomposition solution. 

\section{Coupling Criteria}
\label{sec:couplingCriteria}

A coupling criterion describes a reason why two nanoentities should or should not be owned by the same service. These criteria define the semantic model on which the Service Cutter is built on. 

The coupling criteria in this thesis are a product of literature research and a workshop assembling the collective software architect experience of our thesis advisor Prof. Dr. O. Zimmermann, our industry partner W. Giersche, a seasoned architect of ZÃ¼hlke Engineering, and us. we transformed the resulting ideas into the following structured catalog.

\subsection{Criteria Catalog Overview}

The coupling criteria can be classified in a grid as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cc_grid}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{diagrams/CouplingCatalog.pdf}
	\caption{Coupling criteria grid}
	\label{fig:cc_grid}
\end{figure}

The grid columns and rows represent the following partitions:

\begin{description}
	\item[Cohesiveness] - Criteria describing the cohesivness of nanoentities and  therefore why they should belong to the same service. 
	\item[Compatibility] - Criteria describing the incompatible characteristics of nanoentities. The service should not contain nanoentities with different characteristics. Examples for incompatible characteristics are \enquote{High}, \enquote{Eventually}, and \enquote{Weak} for the criterion \enquote{Consistency}.
	\item[Constraints] - Criteria describing constraints which enforce that group of nanoentities must be distributed amongst different services or form a service by itself. (No entities are assigned to another service; no entities are added to this service.)
	\item[Communication] - Criteria describing which nanoentities are suitable to be used as part of the published language shared between services. 
	\item[Domain] Criteria describing nanoentities from a business domain perspective.
	\item[Quality] Criteria describing the quality of service requirements of a nanoentity.  
	\item[Infrastructure] Criteria describing the infrastructural or technological aspects of nanoentities.
	\item[Security] Criteria describing nanoentities from a security perspective.

\end{description}

\subsection{CC Cards}

We specified all coupling criteria listed in the grid as \enquote{CC cards} like the following:

\newcommand{\ccCard}[8] {
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
	\begin{framed}
	\textbf{#1 #2}
	
		\begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries User Representation}]
		\item[Description] #3
		\item[User Representation] #4 %TODO source?
		\ifthenelse{\equal{#5}{}}{}{\item[Literature] #5}
		\item[Type] #6
		\item[Perspective] #7
		%\ifx #8\empty  #8 \fi
		\ifthenelse{\equal{#8}{}}{}{\item[Characteristics] #8}
		\end{description}
	
	\end{framed}
\end{minipage}
}
\ccCard{CC-1}{Identity \& Lifecycle Commonality}{Nanoentities that belong to the same identity and therefore share a common lifecycle. }{- UML class diagrams (Same Class, Composition, Inheritance) \newline - Domain-Driven Design entities.}{Entity definition in Domain-Driven Design: \newline \textit{Some objects are not defined primarily by their attributes. They represent a thread of identity that	runs through time and often across distinct representations.}\cite{evans2003domain}}{Cohesiveness}{Domain}{}


Cards share the following information:

\begin{description}
	\item[Description] Explains the coupling criteria in more detail.
	\item[User Representation] Lists familiar concepts that can be used to feed the criteria information into the Service Cutter.
	\item[Literature] References the coupling criteria to descriptions in existing literature.
	\item[Type] The type of the criterion: Cohesiveness, Compatibility, Constraint or Communication.
	\item[Perspective] The perspective of the criterion: Domain, Quality, Infrastructure or Security. 
	\item[Characteristics] Cards of type \enquote{compatibility} list different characteristics that can be applied to a nanoentity.

\section{What is a good Decomposition Solution?}
\label{sec:decompositionRequirements}

Based on the coupling criteria described above and to achieve the introduced principles , we define a good decomposition solution as following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Not violating any constraints criteria.
	\item Combining as few nanoentities with different characteristics in one service as possible.
	\item Each service should depend on as few nanoentities of other services as possible (A use case should cross as few service boundaries as possible).
	\item Nanoentities which are part of a published language between services should be suitable for inter service communication (Network Traffic Suitability, Mutability).
	\item The coupling a single service has to other services should be similar for all services. It is not the size of services that requires homogeneity within the system but the amount of published language  each service shares. 
	\item Not too many services which leads to the nanoservice antipattern\cite{nanoservice}.
	\item Not too few services, which leads to a monolithic architecture.
\end{enumerate}



%TODO User stories as most important criteria: check Ivar Jacobson, oose, a use case driven approach

%TODO: Should we describe non relevant coupling criteria as well? (Hiding design decisions etc, see CC catalog doc)

%TODO: (Bring result \& discussion already here?)
