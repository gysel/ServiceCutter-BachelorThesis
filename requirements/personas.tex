Our personas are based on ??. % TODO workshops, interviews, discussions?

All users of the system are experienced software architects or developers interested in the educational aspects of the tool.

\subsection{Adam Architect}

Adam is an experienced architect with many years of experience in the industry and has build several systems already. In the design phase of his new product he wants to challenge his preconceived ideas on the soon to be architecture with the help of a tool. 

Furthermore he can also use the Service Cutter to document his analysis of the data model. The exported data model can be stored and imported into the Service Cutter by his fellow colleagues at a later point in time.

\subsection{Stan Student}

Stan studies Computer Science and as part of his class in Service oriented Software Architecture he is supposed to design a set of services for the ZooKeeper domain. The Service Cutter guides him through the important decisions by asking a set of questions and presents him a set of possible service cuts. Stan then discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the presented options with his fellow students.

\subsection{Tom Tutor}

Tom wants to introduce his students to the software architecture craft. He uses the Service Cutter to visualize the different ways of distribute data into services during his lectures. By changing the calculation parameters he can demonstrate that software architecture mostly depends on the context of the requirement. The same problem may have to different solutions in varying circumstances.
