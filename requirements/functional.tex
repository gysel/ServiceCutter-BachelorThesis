\subsection{Data Fields and Entities}

A set of data fields can either be defined in the application or imported using a predefined data format. A data field consists of it's name and a combination of connections to other fields, referred to as Coupling Criteria.

\subsection{Coupling Criteria}

All data fields are related to other fields. The concept of a Coupling Criterion is used to characterise such connections.

The most common Coupling Criterion is \textit{Same Entity} which is commonly modeled using Entities. %TODO cite https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model
