\section{Project Management Methodology}

We chose Scrum as the project management methodology for this bachelor thesis. Scrum specifies an iterative and incremental approach which encourages a high involvement of the customer. This characteristics suit the requirements of a bachelor thesis well,
as it provides only a short project definition at project start and, in our case, requires close collaboration with our advisor and industry partner.
