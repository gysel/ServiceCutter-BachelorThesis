Starting with Microservices, what news they bring (deployability) and what old, underlying problem they try to solve (decomposition)

These: There is more to service decomposition than "Belongs to bigger concept defined by noun or verb(Chris Richardson)
=> Goal/Idea

- Identify coupling criteria and constraints after which service 
decomposition should be done. 

- Build a tool that takes data fields and applied coupling criteria and constraints as input and produces suggestions on how to split the system in different parts.

Focus only on data, not on logic. (??)

No focus on ways to handle or soften coupling (async, interfaces, messaging, CAP, REST, RPC, etc.)
