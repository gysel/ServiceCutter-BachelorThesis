\chapter{Clustering Graph Evaluation}
\label{appendix:graphClustering}

To implement the weighted graph approach described in Section \ref{subsec:approach1_graph}, a clustering algorithm is required to split the graph into as little as possible connected groups of data fields. 

The following requirements should be met by the algorithm implementation:

	\begin{tabular}{|p{100pt}|p{250pt}|p{50pt}|}
		\hline	
		Name & Description & Priority \\
		\hline
		Distinct Clusters & Every field is contained once and only once in a cluster & High  \\
		\hline
		Balanced Coupling & The sum of weights of the edges a cluster connects with other clusters should be similar for all clusters & High \\
		\hline
		Minimal Coupling & The total weight of the edges connecting clusters should be minimal & High \\
		\hline
		Implementation & A free implementation of the algorithm should be available either in Java or another language easily callable from the \gls{JVM}. & High  \\
		\hline
		Number of Clusters & The number of clusters should be defined by a parameter & Medium \\
		\hline
		Performance & An algorithm run with 2000 edges should not take longer than 2 minutes on an average laptop. & Medium \\
		\hline
		Simplicity & It should be possible to understand the mechanism and parameters of the algorithm within a day with the mathematical background we have from the studies at \gls{HSR} & Low \\
		\hline
		%TODO: specify more
		Hardship Cases & Cases in which it is unclear which cut is best should be made visible in form of a hint or multiple solution suggestions. & Low \\
		\hline
