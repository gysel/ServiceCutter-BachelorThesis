\chapter{Conclusion}


\section{Working with the Service Cutter}
%TODO: Does this chapter make sense? it could cover the process of working with the service cutter, finding the needed information, intepreting the results and using it for decision finding and documentations (ADs). Giersche highly recommended/requested this. 

Potential contents of this chapter:

\begin{itemize}
\item How do you initially populate all the coupling data? LOTS of knowledge is required!
\item How do you organize such an interview?
\item Documentation of input format?
\item Interpreting the result?
\item When to choose which algorithm?
\item Recommendations for working with the priorities.
\item What to do with the output? How to feed it back into the loop in the next release cycle?
\end{itemize}
